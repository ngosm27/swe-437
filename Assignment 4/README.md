# How to Install and Run Assignment #4

Maven is used in this assignment to automate the building process for ConversionGui.java and ConversionGuiTest.java, which both uses JavaFx. Before attempting to run the application, be sure to [download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the [installation instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

After installing Maven, cd into the `conversion` directory and type in the following to build and run:

`mvn package`

The build log should appear with the tester results shown at the end (in green).
